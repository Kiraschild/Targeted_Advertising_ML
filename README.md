# Targeted_Advertising_ML
A tool that compares the accuracy of different techniques used to determine how probable the user is to click on an advertisement.
We turn the provided CSV file into a data frame called data. We can find out the data type, the number of records, and whether or not a column is null using the info function of the Pandas data frame.
We will assess the correlation between the columns after preprocessing our data, and then plot it on a heatmap. We can examine the degree of association between different variables and the "clicked on ad" variable from the heatmap.
Then we will be applying the decision tree classifier and logistic regression method using skitlearn.
